    "# Building a CNN on Fashion MNIST\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how a data scientist would approach exploring a dataset, building a model, and saving that model within a workflow utilizing [Quilt T4](https://quiltdocs.gitbook.io/t4/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a convolutional neural network based on the [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) dataset. Fashion MNIST is an image dataset curated by the folks at Zalando Research specifically for the purpose of providing a good default dataset for use in image classification tasks. It consists of a moderately large set of 28x28 images of various fashion items, which have been assigned to one of ten different classes. This dataset is useful for benchmarking image classification challenges, as it is significantly harder than the extremely well-known MNIST dataset, whilst still being easy enough that relatively straightforward image classification techniques may be used to solve it. Classification of clothing (for the purposes of recommendation) is a very well-traveled problem in startups these days, and this well-curated dataset is a great introduction to this problem.\n",
