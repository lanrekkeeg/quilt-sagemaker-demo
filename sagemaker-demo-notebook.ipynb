    "\n",
    "This notebook is an interactive companion to the article. In it we will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build a machine learning model image and store it on ECR, Amazon's container registry service.\n",
    "* Train a machine learning model based on the image we just pushed.\n",
    "* Deploy that model to a web endpoint.\n",
    "* Deploy an arbitrary Sagemaker-complaint model artifact to a web endpoint.\n",
    "* Perform a batch classification job using a SageMaker-compliant model artifact (unfinished?).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may run this notebook either locally or in an AWS SageMaker instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running locally, make sure that the account you are running this notebook under has all of the necessary permissions: `S3ReadOnlyAccess`, `SagemakerFullAccess`, `iam:GetRole`, and `ECRFullAccess`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running on AWS SageMaker, make sure that the role you pass to the notebook instance has all of these permissions available. Note that the default SageMaker execution context is **not** enough; it has the first permissions in the list above but not the latter two. You need to attach those permissions to the instance yourself.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Getting the code\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by downloading the code from [its repository](https://github.com/ResidentMario/quilt-sagemaker-demo) on GitHub."
