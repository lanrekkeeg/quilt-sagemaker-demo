# quilt-sagemaker-demo

The code and environment samples in this repository comprise an MVP for running custom machine learning training and deployment on Amazon SageMaker.

[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sagemaker/) is a machine learning SDK that allows you to build and deploy machine learning algorithms on Amazon AWS. The SageMaker documentation focuses on building and deploying models using pre-trained Docker images. However it is also possible (and extremely useful!) to build and deploy your own custom Docker images.

This repository provides a simple recipe for doing so. To get started, read the article (link forthcoming).
